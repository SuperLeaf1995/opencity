Description:
	This is just another city simulation. The idea is simple: you have
to build a city with 3 types of "zones" Residential, Commercial and
Industrial. They depend on each other during their development.
Try to give them what they need and watch your city growing up.

will be installed on your computer, and an icon will be created inside the
"Game" group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sound & music
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenCity uses SDL_mixer for playing sound & music. Thus, it supports
all file types that SDL_mixer supports.

	If you don't hear any sound, try to modify "sound.m3u" and
set the path accordingly to the "opencity" executable file. Please note
that OpenCity automatically appends a prefix to all the sound filenames.
The prefix is where the installation procedure has put all OpenCity's data
files.

	However, you can put a file called "music.m3u" in the "music" directory
and OpenCity will load and play your favorite musics. If you don't find
any "music" directory just create it then put your list "music.m3u" in it.

	I'd like to warn you that SDL_mixer is not that stable. It can hang
OpenCity while playing few kinds of ".mp3" song. Blame the SDL_mixer's 
guys not me ;) If you experience such a problem, just turn the music 
off (key 'm').


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	From OpenCity 0.0.2, whenever you click the RMB (Right Mouse Button),
you will open the last toolcircle. Click RMB again to hide the opened
toolcircle. I try to make everything simple and handy. But sometimes you
still need your keyboard.

	OpenCity now understand the mouse's wheel ! Push the wheel forward
does a zoom in (as 'Insert' key) and roll the wheel backward does a
zoom out (as 'Delete' key).

	When you hold 'Shift' and play with your mouse's wheel you'll notice
that it translates the map in some direction. Whereas the 'Ctrl' button
translates the map along another axis.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main config file "opencity.conf"

Troubleshootings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1) I have a ATI Radeon 9000 M video card on my machine.
When I tested the game with "EnablePageFlip" ( see man radeon )
the game works weirdly. If you encounter the same problem,
try to disable this feature of the XFree server ( see man XF86Config )

	2) With ATI Radeon 9000M video card, the SmoothVision(tm)
must be deactivated in order to run OpenCity correctly.

	3) Here is the version of my X server

 - XFree86 Version 4.3.0
 - Release Date: 9 May 2003
 - X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.6
 - Build Operating System: Linux 2.4.18-23mdksmp i686 [ELF]
 - Build Date: 10 September 2003

	It seems that the driver for my ATI Radeon 9000 M is
very buggy. If you experience any trouble, try to type this
in the shell (bash) before launching OpenCity.
		"export R200_NO_VTXFMT="

	Or you should try a newer XFree.
