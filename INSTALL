Extract the sources or go to the root source directory if you've downloaded
the sources from SVN. Then open a console and type at the prompt the
following commands in order to install OpenCity on your computer:


	mkdir obj
	cd obj
	../configure --enable-debug

options. In case you don't have a configure script, the following command
will creat one:

	opencity


That's all, folks !
